  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 lbs (908 g) ground beef (85/15)</li>
    <li>½ tbsp (7.5 g) oil</li>
    <li>¼ cup (37 g) flour (gluten-free if needed)</li>
    <li>3 tbsp (24 g) curry powder</li>
    <li>2 tbsp (16 g) garam masala</li>
    <li>1 small (125 g) onion</li>
    <li>2 medium (150 g) carrots</li>
    <li>1 large (250 g) russet potato</li>
    <li>1 tbsp (15 g) minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 tbsp (15 g) ginger</li>
    <li>4 cups (960 g) beef broth</li>
    <li>2 tbsp (30 g) soy sauce (gluten-free if needed)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp (15 g) Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>8 oz (227 g) frozen peas</li>
    <li>3¾ cups (562.5 g) cooked rice</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook rice to yield 3¾ cups (562.5 g) of cooked rice. 1 cup of dry rice will make between 2-3 cups of cooked rice, depending on the type and cooking method.</li>
    <li>Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook until browned, rendering out the fat.</li>
    <li>Wash and chop vegetables: dice the onion, chop the potato into medium to large pieces, and slice the carrots into thin quarter or half moons. Grate the ginger and mince the garlic.</li>
    <li>Move the beef to the perimeter of the pot, allowing the fat to pool in the center. Add onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook until onions are lightly browned.</li>
    <li>Add curry powder, garam masala, and flour. Stir well to combine.</li>
    <li>Gradually add beef broth while stirring constantly to avoid lumps.</li>
    <li>Add carrots and potatoes. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until potatoes are cooked through.</li>
    <li>Stir in soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and frozen peas. Adjust seasoning to taste.</li>
    <li>Divide cooked rice into 5 servings, with ¾ cup of rice per serving. Spoon the curry over the rice and serve.</li>
